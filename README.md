# Keyboard Light Effects (kfx)

This package is intended to allow the user to render a variety of lighting effects using NeoPixel LED strips using a keyboard.  The package is intended to be extensible and allow the user create their own effects, and map them to keys on the keyboard

## Current effects
### High Frequency Flash
### Static Random Blotches
### Segmented Cycle
### Dictionary Effect
### Marquis Effect

## Current Limitations
### Synchronicity

This package cannot currently play more than one effect simultaneously.  Triggering any effect ends the previous effect, and releasing a key from the piano ends the current effect no matter how many keys are held
